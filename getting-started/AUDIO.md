# Audio in Sesi

Sesi includes three optional standard-library modules for working with sound: `std/audio` for synthesis and playback, `std/theory` for music-theory helpers, and `std/mpc` for Akai MPC-inspired track sequencing, Roger Linn swing, pad matrices, choke groups, AIR multi-mode effects, and vintage hardware converter modeling. None require external installation — just `allow` the module and go.

---

## Importing the Modules

```
allow "std/audio" in as <alias>
allow "std/theory" in as <alias>
allow "std/mpc" in as <alias>
```

`allow` loads a module and binds it to any identifier you choose — the name after `as` is just a local namespace alias. These are all equally valid:

```sesi
allow "std/audio" in as Audio      // conventional
allow "std/audio" in as sound      // also fine
allow "std/audio" in as snd        // also fine
allow "std/audio" in as a          // also fine
```

The examples below use `Audio`, `Music`, and `MPC` as readable conventions, but you are free to pick any name that fits your script.

---

## std/audio — Sound Synthesis & Playback

### Beep — `Audio.beep`

```
Audio.beep(frequency, duration)
```

Play a simple sine-wave tone. `frequency` is in Hz; `duration` is in milliseconds.

```sesi
allow "std/audio" in as Audio

Audio.beep(440, 200)   // 440 Hz (concert A) for 200 ms
Audio.beep(880, 100)   // one octave up, shorter
```

---

### Play a Note — `Audio.play`

```
Audio.play(note, duration, options?)
```

Play a musical note by name (e.g. `"C4"`, `"A#3"`, `"Bb5"`). `options` accepts ADSR, volume, and panning.

```sesi
allow "std/audio" in as Audio

Audio.play("C4", 500)
Audio.play("E4", 500)
Audio.play("G4", 500)   // C-major chord, played in sequence
```

---

### Synthesize to Base64 — `Audio.synth`

```
Audio.synth(frequency_or_note, duration, type, options?) -> string
```

Returns a base64-encoded WAV string instead of playing audio. Useful for passing audio data to another function or writing it to a file manually.

Supported `type` values: `"sine"`, `"square"`, `"saw"`, `"triangle"`, `"noise"`, `"kick"`, `"snare"`, `"hat"`, `"clap"`.

```sesi
allow "std/audio" in as Audio

let wav_b64 = Audio.synth(440, 1000, "square")
show "WAV data length:" len(wav_b64)
```

---

### Save a Tone — `Audio.save`

```
Audio.save(path, frequency_or_note, duration, type, options?)
```

Synthesize a tone and write it directly to a WAV file.

```sesi
allow "std/audio" in as Audio

// Save a 2-second sine-wave A4 note with fade-in and fade-out
Audio.save("tone.wav", "A4", 2000, "sine", {attack: 50, release: 500})
```

---

### Load a WAV File — `Audio.load`

```
Audio.load(path) -> audio_sample
```

Read a WAV file from disk and return an `audio_sample` object containing the decoded PCM data. Useful for inspecting or processing existing audio files.

**Returns:** An object with:

| Field        | Type            | Description                                  |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `samples`    | `array<number>` | Normalized PCM floats in the range `[-1, 1]` |
| `sampleRate` | `number`        | Sample rate in Hz (e.g. `44100`)             |

```sesi
allow "std/audio" in as Audio

let s = Audio.load("loop.wav")
show "Sample rate:" s.sampleRate
show "Total samples:" len(s.samples)
```

---

### Save a Sequence — `Audio.sequence`

```
Audio.sequence(path, notes_array, type, options?)
```

Save a multi-note sequence to a single WAV file. `notes_array` can be:

- An array of note strings: `["C4", "D4", "E4"]`
- An array of note objects with per-note control
- Pre-rendered SF2 note objects (see `Audio.sf2` below)

**Note object fields:**

| Field    | Type     | Description                               |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `note`   | `string` | Note name (e.g. `"C4"`)                   |
| `ms`     | `number` | Duration in milliseconds                  |
| `vol`    | `number` | Volume `0.0–1.0` (default `1.0`)          |
| `pan`    | `number` | Stereo pan `-1.0` (left) to `1.0` (right) |
| `cutoff` | `number` | Low-pass filter cutoff frequency in Hz    |

```sesi
allow "std/audio" in as Audio

let song = [
  {note: "C4", ms: 500, vol: 0.8},
  {note: "E4", ms: 500, pan: -0.5},
  {note: "G4", ms: 1000, cutoff: 5000}
]

Audio.sequence("song.wav", song, "triangle")
show "Saved song.wav"
```

---

### Mix Multiple Tracks — `Audio.mix`

```
Audio.mix(path, tracks_array, type, options?)
```

Mix several tracks into a single stereo WAV. `tracks_array` is an array of note arrays — each inner array is one track. The mixer supports ADSR envelopes, LPF filtering (`cutoff`), stereo `pan`, and soft-clipping saturation (`saturate`).

```sesi
allow "std/audio" in as Audio

let melody = [
  {note: "C4", ms: 500},
  {note: "E4", ms: 500},
  {note: "G4", ms: 500}
]

let bass = [
  {note: "C2", ms: 1500, vol: 0.7}
]

Audio.mix("mix.wav", [melody, bass], "sine", {saturate: 1.2})
show "Saved mix.wav"
```

---

### SoundFont Instruments — `Audio.sf2`

```
Audio.sf2(path, options?) -> fn(note, duration)
```

Load a SoundFont (`.sf2`) file and return an **instrument function** bound to a specific program/patch. Call that function with a note and duration to produce a Sesi-native note object that `Audio.mix` or `Audio.sequence` will batch-render via FluidSynth.

**Options:**

| Field        | Type     | Description                             |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `instrument` | `number` | GM program number (default `0` = piano) |
| `channel`    | `number` | MIDI channel (default `0`)              |
| `gain`       | `number` | Output gain multiplier (default `1.0`)  |

```sesi
allow "std/audio" in as Audio

let piano      = Audio.sf2("GeneralUser-GS.sf2", {instrument: 0,  gain: 1.5})
let string_pad = Audio.sf2("GeneralUser-GS.sf2", {instrument: 49})

let lead = [piano("C4", 500), piano("E4", 500), piano("G4", 500)]
let pad  = [string_pad("C3", 1500)]

Audio.mix("full_mix.wav", [lead, pad], "sine")
show "Saved full_mix.wav"
```

---

### Drum Hits — `Audio.kick` / `Audio.snare` / `Audio.hat` / `Audio.clap`

```
Audio.kick(duration?, volume?)  -> string  // base64 WAV
Audio.snare(duration?, volume?) -> string
Audio.hat(duration?, volume?)   -> string
Audio.clap(duration?, volume?)   -> string
```

Generate a single drum hit using native physical modeling — no SoundFont required. Each function returns a base64-encoded WAV string that can be written to disk with `write_file(..., "base64")` or passed directly into `Audio.mix`.

| Function      | Default `duration` | Default `volume` | Character          |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| `Audio.kick`  | `300` ms           | `1.0`            | Deep, punchy bass  |
| `Audio.snare` | `200` ms           | `1.0`            | Bright crack       |
| `Audio.hat`   | `50` ms            | `1.0`            | Short, sharp click |
| `Audio.clap`  | `100` ms           | `1.0`            | Bright clap        |

```sesi
allow "std/audio" in as Audio

let k = Audio.kick(300, 1.0)
let s = Audio.snare(200, 0.8)
let h = Audio.hat(50, 0.6)

// Save a kick drum directly to disk
write_file("kick.wav", Audio.kick(300), "base64")

// Mix a drum pattern
Audio.mix("drums.wav", [[k, s, h]], "sine")
```

You can also reference them by `type` field inside a sequence note object (the older style still works):

```sesi
Audio.sequence("drums.wav", [
  {note: "C1", ms: 300, type: "kick"},
  {note: "C4", ms: 200, type: "snare"}
], "kick")
```

---

### MIDI Export — `Audio.midi`

```
Audio.midi(path, tracks) -> bool
```

Saves one or more tracks (arrays of note objects/strings) directly as a standard MIDI (.mid) file on disk.

```sesi
allow "std/audio" in as Audio

let track = [
  {note: "C4", ms: 500},
  {note: "E4", ms: 500},
  {note: "G4", ms: 1000}
]

Audio.midi("song.mid", track)
show "MIDI file saved to song.mid"
```

---

---

## std/theory — Music Theory Helpers

`std/theory` removes the manual math from algorithmic composition. It includes helper functions for converting time divisions and chords/scales into Sesi-native note array inputs.

```sesi
allow "std/theory" in as Music
```

---

### Convert Absolute Time — `Music.duration`

```
Music.duration(minutes, seconds) -> number
```

Convert minutes and seconds to absolute milliseconds.

```sesi
allow "std/theory" in as Music

let ms = Music.duration(1, 30) // 90000 ms
```

---

### Convert Bars — `Music.bar`

```
Music.bar(bars, bpm, beatsPerBar?) -> number
```

Convert a number of musical bars into milliseconds based on BPM and time signature (default: 4/4).

```sesi
allow "std/theory" in as Music

let ms = Music.bar(8, 120) // 8 bars at 120bpm -> 16000 ms
```

---

### Generate a Chord — `Music.chord`

```
Music.chord(root, type) -> array<string>
```

Return the notes of a chord rooted at `root`.

**Supported types:** `"M"`, `"m"`, `"dim"`, `"aug"`, `"7"`, `"M7"`, `"m7"`, `"sus2"`, `"sus4"`

```sesi
allow "std/theory" in as Music

let c_maj7  = Music.chord("C4", "M7")  // ["C4", "E4", "G4", "B4"]
let a_minor = Music.chord("A3", "m")   // ["A3", "C4", "E4"]

show c_maj7
```

---

### Generate a Scale — `Music.scale`

```
Music.scale(root, type) -> array<string>
```

Return all notes of a scale starting at `root`.

**Supported types:** `"major"`, `"minor"`, `"dorian"`, `"phrygian"`, `"lydian"`, `"mixolydian"`, `"locrian"`

```sesi
allow "std/theory" in as Music

let a_minor = Music.scale("A3", "minor")
show a_minor
```

---

### Transpose Notes — `Music.transpose`

```
Music.transpose(notes, semitones) -> array<string>
```

Shift a note or an array of notes up (positive) or down (negative) by the given number of semitones.

```sesi
allow "std/theory" in as Music

let c_maj7   = Music.chord("C4", "M7")          // ["C4", "E4", "G4", "B4"]
let f_maj7   = Music.transpose(c_maj7, 5)        // ["F4", "A4", "C5", "E5"]
let b_maj7   = Music.transpose(c_maj7, -1)       // ["B3", "D#4", "F#4", "A#4"]

show f_maj7
```

---

## Combining std/audio and std/theory

```sesi
allow "std/audio"  in as Audio
allow "std/theory" in as Music

// Build a progression from music theory
let c_chord = Music.chord("C4", "M")    // ["C4", "E4", "G4"]
let g_chord = Music.chord("G3", "M7")   // ["G3", "B3", "D4", "F4"]

// Sequence each chord
fn chord_notes(notes, duration) {
  let out = []
  let i = 0
  while i < len(notes) {
    push(out, {note: notes[i], ms: duration})
    i = i + 1
  }
  return out
}

let c_track = chord_notes(c_chord, 600)
let g_track = chord_notes(g_chord, 600)

Audio.sequence("c_chord.wav", c_track, "sine")
Audio.sequence("g_chord.wav", g_track, "triangle")
show "Chord files saved."
```

---

## Error Handling

Wrap audio I/O in `try/catch` to guard against missing files or unsupported formats:

```sesi
allow "std/audio" in as Audio

try {
  Audio.save("output.wav", "C4", 1000, "sine")
  show "Saved successfully"
} catch (err) {
  show "Audio error:" err
}
```

---

## Quick Reference

```sesi
allow "std/audio"  in as Audio
allow "std/theory" in as Music

// Beep
Audio.beep(440, 200)

// Play a note
Audio.play("A4", 500)

// Synth to base64
let b64 = Audio.synth("C4", 1000, "square")

// Save a single tone
Audio.save("tone.wav", "C4", 1000, "sine", {attack: 30, release: 200})

// Load a WAV file into an audio_sample object

show sample.sampleRate

// Drum hits (returns base64 WAV)
let k = Audio.kick(300, 1.0)
let s = Audio.snare(200, 0.8)
let h = Audio.hat(50, 0.6)
write_file("kick.wav", k, "base64")
write_file("snare.wav", s, "base64")
write_file("hat.wav", h, "base64")

// Save a sequence
Audio.sequence("seq.wav", [{note: "C4", ms: 500}, {note: "E4", ms: 500}], "triangle")

// Mix tracks
Audio.mix("mix.wav", [[{note: "C4", ms: 500}], [{note: "C2", ms: 500}]], "sine")

let scale  = Music.scale("C4", "major")
let chord  = Music.chord("A3", "m7")
let moved  = Music.transpose(chord, 7)
```

## std/mpc — Akai MPC Track Sequencing & Performance Controls

`std/mpc` brings authentic Akai MPC (Music Production Center) workflow to Sesi: 16-pad matrix banks, the Roger Linn MPC swing algorithm (50%–75%), 16 Levels performance mode, Note Repeat with triplet divisions, voice Choke Groups, multi-track step sequencing, vintage converter modeling (`mpc60`, `mpc3000`, `sp1200`), AIR multi-mode insert effects, and broadcast-ready WAV and multi-track MIDI file export.

```sesi
allow "std/mpc" in as MPC
```

---

### Create an MPC Sequence — `MPC.sequence`

```
MPC.sequence(name, bars?, bpm?, time_sig?) -> sequence
```

Creates a sequence container with tracks, tempo, bar count, and swing settings.

```sesi
allow "std/mpc" in as MPC

let seq = MPC.sequence("Boom Bap Groove", 2, 92, "4/4")
seq.set_swing(58)         // 58% classic Roger Linn MPC swing
seq.set_vintage("mpc60")  // 12-bit punchy vintage converter emulation
```

---

### Setup a 16-Pad Drum Kit — `MPC.drum_kit`

```
MPC.drum_kit(nameOrPreset?) -> drum_kit
```

Creates an Akai MPC 16-pad drum program. Pads support levels, panning, semitone tuning, fine tuning (cents), envelopes, and choke groups.

```sesi
allow "std/mpc" in as MPC

let kit = MPC.drum_kit("MPC3000 Drums")

// Configure pads
kit.set_pad(1, {sound: "kick", tune: -1, level: 1.0})
kit.set_pad(2, {sound: "rimshot", level: 0.85})
kit.set_pad(3, {sound: "snare", tune: 1, level: 0.95})
kit.set_pad(4, {sound: "clap", level: 0.8})

// Choke group: closed hat (Pad 5) and open hat (Pad 7) share mute_group 1
kit.set_pad(5, {sound: "hat", mute_group: 1, level: 0.75})
kit.set_pad(7, {sound: "open_hat", mute_group: 1, level: 0.85})

// 808 sub bass
kit.set_pad(13, {sound: "808", tune: -2, level: 0.9})
```

---

### Step Sequencing & Track Patterns — `track.pattern`

Add tracks to a sequence and program rhythmic patterns using step notation:
- `'x'`: normal hit (velocity 100)
- `'X'`: full accent (velocity 127)
- `'-'`: ghost note (velocity 45)
- `'1'-'9'`: stepped velocity from 10% to 90%
- `'.'`: rest

```sesi
allow "std/mpc" in as MPC

let seq = MPC.sequence("Dope Beat", 2, 90, "4/4")
let kit = MPC.drum_kit("Boom Bap")

let drums = seq.add_track("Drums", "drum", kit)
drums.pattern(1, "x...x...x...x...") // Kick drum
drums.pattern(3, "....x.......x...") // Snare on beats 2 and 4
drums.pattern(5, "x.x.x.x.x.x.x.x.") // 16th hats with 58% swing
drums.pattern(7, "..x.......x.....") // Open hats (choked by closed hats)
```

For a more visual grid, use bracketed cells. Each cell uses the selected
`resolution`; rows are read left-to-right, then top-to-bottom.

For an eight-column grid that reads as `1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &`, set
`"resolution": "1/8"`. This is one clear 4/4 bar at 130 BPM, with one kick
on every quarter-note beat:

```sesi
let four_on_floor = "
[X][ ][x][ ][x][ ][x][ ]
"
let quantization = {resolution: "1/8"}
drums.pattern(1, four_on_floor, quantization)
```

The four hits map to internal 16th-note steps `0`, `4`, `8`, and `12`:

```text
Visual grid: [X] [ ] [x] [ ] [x] [ ] [x] [ ]
Musical time:  1   &   2   &   3   &   4   &
Kick timing:   X       x       x       x
```

The default `"resolution": "1/16"` remains useful for a 16-column bar, where
each cell is one sixteenth note.

Visual grid cells use the same trigger notation as compact patterns:

| Cell | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `[x]` | Normal hit at the pattern velocity |
| `[X]` | Full accent, velocity `127` |
| `[-]` | Ghost hit, velocity `45` |
| `[1]` to `[9]` | Stepped velocity from 10% to 90% |
| `[ ]` | Empty step / rest |

Use `start_step` to place a visible grid later in a longer arrangement. Since
there are 16 internal steps per 4/4 bar, `start_step: 64` begins the grid at
bar 5:

```sesi
drums.pattern(1, four_on_floor, {
  start_step: 64,
  resolution: "1/8",
  velocity: 112
})
```

---

### 16 Levels Mode — `MPC.sixteen_levels`

```
MPC.sixteen_levels(pad, mode?, options?) -> array<pad_config>
```

The official Akai MPC **16 Levels** button spreads a pad sound across all 16 pads:
- `"velocity"`: 16 stepped velocity gradations from 8 to 127
- `"tune"`: Chromatic tuning across 16 semitones (-12 to +3 semitones or custom base)
- `"filter"`: Stepped lowpass cutoff frequencies from 200 Hz to 18,000 Hz
- `"decay"`: Stepped decay times from 30 ms to 1,200 ms
- `"attack"`: Stepped attack envelope from 0 ms to 500 ms

```sesi
allow "std/mpc" in as MPC

let kit = MPC.drum_kit("Sample Kit")
let sub = kit.get_pad(13)

// Chromatic bassline across 16 pads
let chromatic_pads = MPC.sixteen_levels(sub, "tune")
```

---

### Note Repeat — `MPC.note_repeat`

```
MPC.note_repeat(pad, rate?, bars?, options?) -> array<event>
```

Quantized rhythmic repeats across `"1/4"`, `"1/8"`, `"1/16"`, `"1/32"`, `"1/64"`, and triplet divisions (`"1/4T"`, `"1/8T"`, `"1/16T"`, `"1/32T"`), with velocity ramps (`"crescendo"`, `"decrescendo"`) and accents.

```sesi
allow "std/mpc" in as MPC

// 1 bar of 1/32 hi-hat roll with crescendo
let rolls = MPC.note_repeat(5, "1/32", 1, {ramp: "crescendo", accent: 4})
```

---

### Sample Slicing ("Chop Shop") — `MPC.chop`

```
MPC.chop(sampleOrPath, slices?, options?) -> drum_kit
```

Slices an audio sample or WAV file into equal regions or transients, automatically mapping each slice to Pads 1..16 with voice Choke Group 1 enabled so slices cut each other off.

```sesi
allow "std/mpc" in as MPC

let chops = MPC.chop("vinyl_sample.wav", 16)
let chop1 = chops.get_pad(1)
```

---

### AIR Multi-Mode Effects & Vintage Converters

Apply insert effects on tracks or master bus:
- **`"filter"`**: cutoff, resonance, type (`"lowpass"`, `"highpass"`, `"bandpass"`), drive
- **`"delay"`**: time_ms or sync division (`"1/8"`, `"1/16"`), feedback, ping_pong, damp, mix
- **`"reverb"`**: room decay, damp, mix
- **`"compressor"`**: threshold, ratio, attack, release, makeup gain
- **`"lofi"`**: bit depth, downsampling rate, drive, mix
- **`"eq"`**: low, mid, high dB gain
- **Vintage modeling**: `"mpc60"`, `"mpc3000"`, `"sp1200"`

```sesi
allow "std/mpc" in as MPC

let seq = MPC.sequence("Filtered Beat", 2, 90, "4/4")
seq.add_effect("compressor", {threshold: -14, ratio: 4, makeup: 2})
seq.add_effect("delay", {sync: "1/8", feedback: 0.35, mix: 0.25, ping_pong: true})
```

---

### Exporting Audio and MIDI

```sesi
allow "std/mpc" in as MPC

let seq = MPC.sequence("Master Project", 2, 92, "4/4")
// ... configure tracks ...

// Render 16-bit 44.1kHz Stereo WAV
seq.render_wav("beat.wav")

// Export Type 1 Standard MIDI File with Roger Linn swing preserved
seq.render_midi("beat.mid")

// Or render directly in-memory
let sample = seq.render_wav("memory")
show "Rendered sample count:" len(sample.samples)
MPC.play(sample)
```

---

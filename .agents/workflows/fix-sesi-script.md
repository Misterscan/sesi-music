description: Debugging and validation of error prone sesi scripts.

1. **Draft in file, isolate risky snippet:** Identify the smallest parser/runtime-risky block (prompt block, model call, object schema, loop, etc.).
2. **Validate snippet with eval mode first:** Run `npm run eval "sesi code"` to test the isolated block before full-script execution.
3. **Apply fix in file only after eval passes:** If eval fails, iterate on snippet; do not repeatedly run full scripts while syntax is unresolved.
4. **Validate script with the `test-runner` first before full run:** Run your script actions with a test script using the exports from `bin/test-runner.sesi`. Refer to `main/tests/verify_db.sesi` for an example.
5. **Run full script after validation:** Execute `npm run sesi <file>.sesi` only once the isolated logic is valid.
6. **Use file-aware help when blocked:** Run `npm run help <file>.sesi "<question>"` to get context-grounded help tied to the active script.
7. **NEVER EDIT ANY .SESI FILES IN THE TERMINAL (ABSOLUTE RULE):**
   - Do NOT run `sed`, `awk`, `perl`, or any other shell text-processing tools on `.sesi` files.
   - Do NOT use `npm run eval` to modify files; it is only for syntax validation.
   - Do NOT use Bash/Shell scripting to rewrite or patch Sesi source code.

**Automated Refactoring & Codemods (MANDATORY):**

- If you need to automate file edits, mass refactoring, or search-and-replace tasks across the workspace, you MUST write a repeatable `.sesi` script utilizing Sesi's native I/O (`read_file`/`write_file`) and the global `swap()` function.
- Do NOT write Python scripts, Node.js scripts, or Bash/Shell scripts for workspace file manipulations. Always let Sesi do its job.
  **Why:** Sesi syntax is sensitive to whitespace, newlines, and brace positioning. Terminal-based string replacement will invariably break code.

8. **Emphasize Native Verification Commands:** Prior to saving or running full Sesi scripts, proactively use inline evaluation (`npm run sesi:eval ""sesi code""` or `node bin/sesi.js -e ""...""`) to check and verify syntax and runtime behaviors instantly. It keeps execution cycles fast and deterministic.
9. **Always Check Specifications first:** Verify specifications in the `dist` folder or `.sesi` files before assuming language quirks.

_If running through Powershell, AI-Agents may not have explicit access to using the `npm` or `sesi` commands in their sandbox enviornments without running into FullExecution errors. In this case, use `node bin/sesi.js <file> <option>` in replacement of `npm run sesi`._
